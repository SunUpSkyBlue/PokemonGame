# PokemonGame
A text-based C++ Pok√©mon console game with a battle, healing, and purchase/money system.
Critical hits are calculated using a bernoulli distribution with a 20% chance of occuring any time a move is used.
Critical hits increase move power by 20%, resulting in critical hit attacks causing 120% of the move's power.
To nerf the higher base power of Body Slam, using this move results in the player's Eevee taking recoil damage.
